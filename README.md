# üíô Mental Health AI Companion

A compassionate AI-powered companion designed to provide emotional support for people dealing with depression, anxiety, stress, and other mental health challenges.

- **Clean Interface**: Calming design focused on user wellbeing
- **Real-time Chat**: Smooth typing indicators and message animations
- **Crisis Resources**: Built-in reminders about professional help resources
- **Privacy Focused**: No data storage - conversations stay in browser session

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet 4)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with calming color palette

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **View in Browser**

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a demo/concept application**
- The Claude API calls are configured but require proper authentication in production
- This is NOT a replacement for professional mental health care
- In a production environment, API calls should go through a secure backend

## API Integration

The app uses Anthropic's Claude API with a custom system prompt optimized for empathetic mental health support. The prompt ensures:
- Validation of feelings
- Non-judgmental responses  
- Appropriate boundaries
- Crisis resource suggestions when needed

## Crisis Resources

If you or someone you know is in crisis:
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**: Call or text 988
- **Crisis Text Line**: Text HOME to 741741
- **International Association for Suicide Prevention**: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/

## Future Enhancements

- Mood tracking functionality
- Journaling features
- Coping strategy library
- Professional therapist matching
- Anonymous user accounts
- Conversation history (with consent)

## Demo Purpose

This project was created as a concept demo to showcase:
- Clean React component architecture
- AI API integration
- Thoughtful UX for sensitive use cases
- Understanding of mental health app considerations
